# e-shop
This project is based on an eCommerce website built with React. The user can add items to the cart, increase or decrease the number of items on the cart, or even empty the cart. The user can also click on checkout from the cart and pay by entering his/her credit card number. The user will receive a confirmation message after successful paying. Use stripe's demo card number for testing 4242 4242 4242 4242   04/24 242 42424.
